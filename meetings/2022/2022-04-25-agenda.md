# Agenda topics

## Welcome new members

## Actions from previous meetings

**Jeremy Bennett** and **Paolo Savini** to rework the presentation on execution speed measurements to focus just on time and time ratios.

- deferred from previous meeting.

**Ray Simar** to investigate if any programs in [Energy efficiency across programming languages: how do energy, time, and memory relate?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3136014.3136031) are suitable for Embench 2.0.

- deferred from previous meeting, but noted seem to be toy applications

**Ray Simar** and **Will Jones** (Embecosm) to investigate TinyMLPerf.

**Jeremy Bennett** and **Paolo Savini** to run some tests using both CoreMark and Dhrystone as well as Embench as input data to Dave Patterson.

**Jeremy Bennett** to progress bit manipulation example from Embecosm into a future benchmark.

**Jeremy Bennett** to provide details of Embench to RISC-V International for their web page on benchmarks.

## Journal paper on Embench

This paper is being prepared by Dave Patterson to be the definitive reference for the benchmark.

Paolo Savini and Jeremy Bennett will give an update on their data gathering.  They are aiming to get Embench, CoreMark and Dhrystone scores for the following architectures/boards:
- Arm Cortex M4 (STM Disovery board @ 16MHz)
- 32-bit RISC-V (SiFive HiFive1 board rev B)
- 32-bit MIPS core (MicroChip Curiosity PIC32 MX470)
- 32-bit RISC-V (CHIP EH1 Verilator model)

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

GSoC 2022 application closed on Tuesday 19 April.  Embench had three project ideas on the [FOSSi list](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/gsoc22-ideas). An update will be given at the meeting.

## Questions about Embench

This is an opportunity to ask questions of the group.
