## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

FOSSi (our parent organization) has been accepted as a GSoC 2022 organization. We have three project ideas on the [FOSSi list](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/gsoc22-ideas)

- Embench DSP Extensions, mentored by Ray Simar.
- Embench Interrupt Latency benchmark, mentored by Ofer Shinaar and colleagues.
- Porting Compiler test-suite (micro-benchmarks) to Embench, mentored by Ofer Shinaar and colleagues.

Potential GSoC contributors now have until 3 April to discuss projects with mentors, and then from 4-19 April to apply.  FOSSi have a limited number of projects allocated by Google, and they will be allocated on merit. So it is in our interest to encourage really strong applicants for the Embench projects.

Thanks to Ray Simar and Ofer Shinaar for putting these together.

## Questions about Embench

We introduced this last month.  This is an opportunity to ask questions of the group.
