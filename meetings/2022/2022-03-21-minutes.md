- deferred from previous meeting.

**Ray Simar** to investigate if any programs in [Energy efficiency across programming languages: how do energy, time, and memory relate?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3136014.3136031) are suitable for Embench 2.0.

- deferred from previous meeting, but noted seem to be toy applications

**Ray Anderson** and **Will Jones** (Embecosm) to investigate TinyMLPerf.

**Jeremy Bennett** and **Paolo Savini** to run some tests using both CoreMark and Dhrystone as well as Embench as input data to Dave Patterson.

**Jeremy Bennett** to progress bit manipulation example from Embecosm into a
future benchmark.

**Jeremy Bennett** to provide details of Embench to RISC-V International for their web page on benchmarks.

## Google Summer of Code

FOSSi (our parent organization) has been accepted as a GSoC 2022 organization. We have three project ideas on the [FOSSi list](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/gsoc22-ideas)

- Embench DSP Extensions, mentored by Ray Simar.
- Embench Interrupt Latency benchmark, mentored by Ofer Shinaar and colleagues.
- Porting Compiler test-suite (micro-benchmarks) to Embench, mentored by Ofer Shinaar and colleagues.

Potential GSoC contributors now have until 3 April to discuss projects with mentors, and then from 4-19 April to apply.  FOSSi have a limited number of projects allocated by Google, and they will be allocated on merit. So it is in our interest to encourage really strong applicants for the Embench projects.

Thanks to Ray Simar and Ofer Shinaar for putting these together.

The [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and [help for students and mentors](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide) can be found on the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## Questions about Embench

## New benchmarks for Embench IoT 2.0

The [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFBsA6VEQfJ8yG6wbBwgiY6GKOYLVNJvqIfqKYYyX60/edit?usp=sharing) is now open for submissions, for both new benchmarks and benchmarks to cull.

An Embecosm customer has noted the lack of any benchmark which is heavy in bit manipulation.  We hope that this may lead to contribution of a new benchmark in this area.

**Action** Jeremy Bennett to progress bit manipulation example from Embecosm into a future benchmark.

## Publicity

The RISC-V Board of Directors have recently discussed software strategy. Want a web page listing the benchmarks. Dave has volunteered Embench.

**Action** Jeremy Bennett to provide details of Embench to RISC-V International for their web page on benchmarks.

There is an opportunity to speak at the London RISC-V meetup.

## Next meeting

We currently meet regularly on the third Monday of each month 8-9am California time.

The following are the dates for the remainder of 2022
