# Agenda topics

## Welcome new members

## Actions from previous meetings

**Jeremy Bennett** and **Paolo Savini** to rework the presentation on execution speed measurements to focus just on time and time ratios.

- carried forward.

**Ray Simar** and **Will Jones** (Embecosm) to investigate TinyMLPerf.

- carried forward.

**Jeremy Bennett** and **Paolo Savini** to run some tests using both CoreMark and Dhrystone as well as Embench as input data to David Patterson's paper. Results to be shared in a spreadsheet with benchmark results and post to the mailing list.

- initial results to be presented during meeting (see below).
- some results do not look credible and need verification.
- carried forward to complete the work.

**Jeremy Bennett** to progress bit manipulation example from Embecosm into a future benchmark.

- carried forward.

## GitHub pull requests

### From embench-iot:

The following new pull request has been received since our last meeting.

- [#162](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/162) Adding Full Support to WallyVerilog.
  - Thanks to Daniel Torres and Dave Harris for this contribution.
  - Includes fixes to JSON output and future md5sum benchmark, so suggest split into 3 PRs.
  - Technical content all reviewed and good.

The following pull requests are still open and under review:

- [#153](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/153) Fix non-existing executables.
- [#152](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/152) Remove debug printfs from md5sum.
- [#151](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/151) Some fixes for build scripts.
- [#148](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/148) Board config for Freedom E310 Arty FPGA.
- [#147](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/147) Use calloc_beebs in md5sum.
- [#145](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/145) Add --benchmark and --exclude options to scripts fore debugging.
- [#144](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/144) Replace pyelftools with lief.
- [#130](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/130) Improve JSON output of benchmarking.

### From embench-rt:

There are no new pull requests this month and none remain open and under review.

## New GitHub new open issues

### From embench-iot:

The following issue has been received

- [#161](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/161) In the st benchmark some toolchains hoisting/removing the computation from the benchmarking loop
  - modern compilers are too good for this benchmark as written
  - the issue includes a suggestion for fixing the problem
  - realistically we still need a statistics benchmark in Embench 2.0.
  - thanks to Mark Hill for raising this.

A total of 44 issues remain open.

### From embench-rt:

There are no new issues raised this month.

A total of 1 issue remains open.

## Journal paper on Embench

This paper is being prepared by Dave Patterson to be the definitive reference for the benchmark.

Paolo Savini and Will Jones have obtained data for the latest GCC and Clang/LLVM compilers for the reference Arm Cortex-M4 board and the new CORE-V MCU running on a Nexys A7 FPGA board.  The results need review, since some of the datapoints look suspicious.  Will and Paolo will present their results so far.

## Update on WallyVerilog

(see also PR [#162](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/162) above).

David Harris and Daniel Torres will present their results obtained using Verilog simulation of the Wally core.

## Questions about Embench

This is an opportunity to ask questions of the group.

## New benchmarks for Embench IoT 2.0

The [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFBsA6VEQfJ8yG6wbBwgiY6GKOYLVNJvqIfqKYYyX60/edit?usp=sharing) is now open for submissions, for both new benchmarks and benchmarks to cull.

Note that issue [#161](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/161) identifies a problem with the current `st` benchmark.

## Publicity

Jeremy Bennett will present the leaflet on using Embench being distributed by Embecosm at their stand at Embedded World.

All are invited to report back, including on opportunities for meetings where Embench should be presented.

## Next meeting

We currently meet regularly on the third Monday of each month 8-9am California time.

The following dates are proposed for 2022

- Mon 18 Jul 2022
- Mon 15 Aug 2022
