## Journal paper on Embench

This paper is being prepared by Dave Patterson to be the definitive reference for the benchmark.

There is an outstanding action on Jeremy Bennett, Paolo Savini and Will Jones to review the results presented in July, which do not look credible.

## Questions about Embench

This is an opportunity to ask questions of the group.

## New benchmarks for Embench IoT 2.0

The [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFBsA6VEQfJ8yG6wbBwgiY6GKOYLVNJvqIfqKYYyX60/edit?usp=sharing) is now open for submissions, for both new benchmarks and benchmarks to cull.

## Publicity

Ray Simar group will be presenting â€œNew DSP Extensions to the Embench Benchmark Suite" at the RSIC-V Summit.  The presentation will be on Wednesday (12/14) at 11:45 AM - 12:05 PM.  Details in the [official schedule](https://sched.co/1CD5d).

All are invited to report back, including on opportunities for meetings where Embench should be presented.
