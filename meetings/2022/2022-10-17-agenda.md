This paper is being prepared by Dave Patterson to be the definitive reference for the benchmark.

There is an outstanding action on Jeremy Bennett, Paolo Savini and Will Jones to review the results presented in July, which do not look credible.

## Questions about Embench

This is an opportunity to ask questions of the group.

## New benchmarks for Embench IoT 2.0

The [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFBsA6VEQfJ8yG6wbBwgiY6GKOYLVNJvqIfqKYYyX60/edit?usp=sharing) is now open for submissions, for both new benchmarks and benchmarks to cull.
