# Agenda topics

## Welcome new members

## Actions from previous meetings

 **Action:** Jeremy Bennett and Paolo Savini to rework the presentation on execution speed measurements to focus just on time and time ratios.

- deferred from previous meeting.

### From embench-rt:

There are no new pull requests this month and none remain open and under review.

## New GitHub new open issues

### From embench-iot:

The following issues have been received

- [#156](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/156) json-comma and no-json-comma option cause error
- [#154](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/154) Adding const function attribute to sqrt function in math.h will reduce the execution time for 'nbody' benchmark significantly

Thanks to Huaqi Fang and Tilak Girijeswar for raising these.

A total of 41 issues remain open.

### From embench-rt:

There are no new issues raised this month.

A total of 1 issue remains open.

## Google Summer of Code

We currently have three projects proposed for GSoC under the FOSSi umbrella

- Embench DSP Extensions
- Embench Interrupt Latency benchmark
- Porting Compiler test-suite (micro-benchmarks) to Embench

Thanks to Ray Simar and Ofer Kindgren for putting these together. These will be used to help justify FOSSi having projects sponsored by Google. We still have an opportunity to refine these projects or add new projects.  The current list is beign put together by the Org Admin for FOSSi, Jonathan Balkind, [here](https://github.com/Jbalkind/fossi-foundation.github.io/blob/gsoc22-ideas/gsoc22-ideas.md).

## Questions about Embench

This is a new item on the agenda, but it seems a good idea. David Harris, a new user of Embench has asked:

- I’d like to learn whether there is a standard way that RISC-V processors are instrumented to report CYCLES and MINSTRET from the Embench tests, or whether that’s something I need to write and link to the code.  

- I’d also like to know if there’s a standard way that the benchmarks terminate.  For example, riscv-arch-test terminates with a call to the HTIF by writing a success/failure code to tohost, and my Verilog testbench detects that for termination.  It appears the uninstrumented testbench terminates with a return instruction.

## New benchmarks for Embench IoT 2.0

The [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFBsA6VEQfJ8yG6wbBwgiY6GKOYLVNJvqIfqKYYyX60/edit?usp=sharing) is now open for submissions, for both new benchmarks and benchmarks to cull.

No new benchmarks have been proposed this month.

## Publicity

All are invited to report back, including on opportunities for meetings where Embench should be presented.
