[#108](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/108) build_all.py: Notify users of known arch, chip and board options.

- thanks to Olof Kindgren for the fix.
- merged.

## New GitHub new open issues

### From embench-iot:

[#109](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/109) rand_beebs has undefined behaviour for targets with 32 bit long.

- marked as bug, to fix for a future release
- assigned to Paolo Savini to fix
- thanks to Joern Rennecke for raising this.

## Requirements for measuring context switch latency

A discussion, based on the proposed requirements circulated by Ofer Shinaar on the mailing list.

## Reports on other benchmarks

An invitation for those working on benchmarks to report on progress

- Julian Kunkel, Paolo Savini and Roger Shepherd on `embench-iot` computational benchmarks (now open for candidate benchmarks for embench-iot 2.0).
- Ronen Haen, Ray Simar on `embench-rt` benchmarks

## Release 1.0 update of embench-iot

Release 1.0 is now tagged and its own branch. The only changes that will be made to this branch are if there is some critical failure that renders the benchmark unusable.

## Start of work on embench-iot 2.0

All future development will be on the master branch, which will form the basis of Embench IoT benchmark release 2.0, targeted for Q1/2023.

As an initial part of that discussion we already have two proposed substitute benchmarks
- MD5sum from Julian Kunkel
- Simple primes benchmark from Bruce Hoult

Suggestions for other new benchmarks, and which we should retire. `cubic` is notoriously an outlier for using `long double`.

## Publicity

Embench 1.0 was announced on Tuesday 19 January.
- [Announcement](https://www.embench.org/news.html) on the Embench website and the [FOSSi website](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/2021/01/19/embench-1-0)
