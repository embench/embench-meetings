## Google Summer of Code

Embench is part of the Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation (FOSSi), which in turn is an active participant in the Google Summer of Code, which provides stipends for students and early career engineers to work on open source projects.

We should take advantage of this to propose either medium (175 hour) or large (350 hour) projects to work on Embench.  The competitive selection process takes place in Q1/2022 and each project requires either 1 or 2 mentors to guide the student through the work.

## New benchmarks for Embench IoT 2.0

The [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFBsA6VEQfJ8yG6wbBwgiY6GKOYLVNJvqIfqKYYyX60/edit?usp=sharing) is now open for submissions, for both new benchmarks and benchmarks to cull.

No new benchmarks have been proposed this month.

All are invited to report back, including on opportunities for meetings where Embench should be presented.
