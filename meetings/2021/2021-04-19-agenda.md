## New benchmarks for Embench IoT 2.0

Nidal is starting porting WD size test cases to the Embench github (see [this thread](https://lists.librecores.org/pipermail/embench/2021-March/000112.html)).

The [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFBsA6VEQfJ8yG6wbBwgiY6GKOYLVNJvqIfqKYYyX60/edit?usp=sharing) is now open for submissions, for both new benchmarks and benchmarks to cull.
