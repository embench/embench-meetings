# Agenda topics

## Welcome

Welcome to H. Hayashi and thanks for the recent contributions to Embench.

## Actions from previous meeting

- **Ray Simar**: we missed the deadline for the RISC-V Summit lightning talk. More work to present for next time.
  Other venues could be used.

- **Ofer Shinaar**:
  [#4](https://github.com/embench/embench-rt/issues/4) Promote Latency result.
  [#2](https://github.com/embench/embench-rt/pull/2) new context switch benchmark

  Call for comments or any concern. Any volunteer to port the latency support to the Cortex M3 is welcome.
  Ready to merge and publish results once these are solved.

- **Nidal Faour**: demonstrated the proposed build system.
  Observations and key points:
  - portability. The new system has self-maintainence.
  - security when automatic download of packages is involved.
    Dockers can prevent internet accesses from the packages.
  - run in an RTL environment.
  - benchmark build systems need simplicity of use and structure.

  Given the key points above the build systems appears to be more mature and
  easy to maintain than the current python scripts.
  A switch to the new build system will be considered for a few months from now.
  Volunteers are welcome to try it. Current volunteers:
  - **Bill McSpadden**
  - **Jeremy Bennett** and **Paolo Savini**
  - **H. Hayashi**
  
  Some work is still needed to ratify and open source the build system.

- **Paolo Savini**: presentation deferred to next meeting.

## Further work on embench-rt

At a meeting earlier this year, there was a student volunteer to work on the Embench Real-Time project.
Unfortunately, the minutes did not record the name of that volunteer.
The Embench-RT team would be very pleased to make contact with the volunteer.
Any other volunteer welcome.

## New benchmarks for Embench IoT 2.0

The [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFBsA6VEQfJ8yG6wbBwgiY6GKOYLVNJvqIfqKYYyX60/edit?usp=sharing) is now open for submissions, for both new benchmarks and benchmarks to cull.

No new benchmarks were proposed this month.

## Publicity

Noted that getting the word out about Embench. Target retrospective paper at Embedded World in February 2022.

Missed the deadline for a RISC-V Summit lightning talk. Will look into next year's event and other venues.

Suggest a presentation focusing on role of Embench within the academic community and working with industry to solve issue of pre-silicon (simulation) benchmarking.

## Next meeting

We currently meet regularly on the third Monday of each month 8-9am California time.

The following dates are proposed for 2021

- Mon 15 Nov 2021
- Mon 13 Dec 2021 (week 2, to keep clear of Christmas)

Jeremy created a calendar entry for our regular attendees, to provide automated reminders. Please ask if you wish to be added to this.
