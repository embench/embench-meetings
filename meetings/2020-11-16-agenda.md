## Update on benchmarks

### Benchmarking other platforms

Roger Shepherd and Paolo Savini to report on progress

### Experience with Embench

We have invited Sheena Goel to share her experience of using Embench for a commercial project.

### Parallel Embench

We have invited Erin Olson of Seagate to present her extensions to the build infrastructure to support parallel running of Embench benchmarks to reduce benchmark elapsed time.  This is currently available as a pull request [#100](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/pull/100).

### Updates to the interrupt latency/context switching benchmark

This was always conceived of as a key part of Embench, with an initial framework created by Cesare Garlati of HexFive.  Ronen Haen of Western Digital has proposed developing this futher in pull request [#1](https://github.com/embench/embench-context-latency/pull/1).  We have invited Ronen to present his proposal.

### Embench 0.6

Ray Sinar to report on progress with his class at Rice University on Embench 0.6.

### Volunteers wanted

Great to see the contributions this month from Seagate, Western Digital and Rice University.  A reminder that we continue to need volunteers to lead particular aspects of current and future efforts.

## Publicity

### Recent publicity

All are invited to report back. Here are some that we know about.

Karol Gugala's talk on the Embench Tester he has developed at Antmicro excited considerable interest and was subsequently presented the RISC-V Chairs Weekly meeting.

Jeremy Bennett presented a talk on automation of compiler development at the Huawei Russia workshop on modern compiler development.  Almost all the discussion was around the benchmarks used, the details of Embench were shared and attendees were encouraged to participate.

### PR materials in development

Stefan Wallentowitz to report on progress with his interview style blog post about Embench, based on interview responses from Dave Patterson and Jeremy Bennett

### Future meetings

All are invited to suggest meeting where Embench should be presented.

## Next meeting

We currently meet regularly on the third Monday of each month 8-9am California time. Our future meetings will be. Note that the Decmember date has been changed to avoid the week before Christmas.

- Mon 14 Dec 2020 (changed)

automated reminders. Please ask if you wish to be added to this.

## AOB

I have started to record meeting agendas, minutes and supplementary materials in a new [embench-meetings](https://github.com/embench/embench-meetings) repository.  This makes life slightly easier when putting together agendas and minutes, and makes locating materials easy.
