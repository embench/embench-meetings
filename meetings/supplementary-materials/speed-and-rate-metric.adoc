[[Motivation]]
== Overview

=== Motivation
On the embedded space, sometimes throughput is more important than latency.
Those days we can start seeing emerging IoT cores/MCUs that have a multithreaded
design. On Those designs score for *rate/throughput* will be more critical than
a score for *speed*. It is straightforward to estimate the *rate* score of
multi-core without shared resources, but with HW multi-threading, resource
sharing is built-in. Even for multi-core without HW threading, sharing for
resources is inevitable.
E.g. Crossbar matrix is shared among the multi-cores, and it will impact the
score result.




[[Speed-Metric]]
== Speed Metric (Embench native Metric)
* Measure latency: how fast the CPU completes a single workload.
* Benchmark Score Formula:

****
`*Reference-Time~(one-workload)~ / Platform-under-Test-Time~(one-workload)~*`
****
* Final Score: Geomean



[[Rate-metric]]
== Rate metric
* Measure throughput: for a given frame time, how many copies of the same
workload the CPU can do.
* Benchmark score formula:
****
`*N = Number of workload copies under test*` {nbsp} +

`*N * Reference-Time~(one-workload-copy)~ /
Platform-under-Test-Time~(all-workload-copies)~*`
****
* Final Score: Geomean

NOTE: We need to use the same reference time for both, speed and rate
